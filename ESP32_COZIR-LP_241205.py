#This is the leanest script I could find to do the following tasks:
#- Initiate a measurement cycle of ten consecutive CO2 measurements every 24 hours
#- Send each measurement value via WiFi to an MQTT broker
#- Store each measurement value consecutively in a text document in the internal flash memory of the ESP32
#- Go into deepsleep mode between measurement cycles to save power
